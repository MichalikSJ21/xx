        <h1>Reason 3</h1>
        <div>
            I love the vast breadth our conversations have. They can go all over the place and it is so much fun to talk with you
            One moment we are talking about our deepest feelings and problems that we both have in our lives, and the next second, 
            we are both busy laughing our heads off about something completely ridiculous. There's such incredible variety and I 
            always look forward to talking to you for that reason. No matter what I know that our conversations will be completely awesome.

            I'll try to give as good of an example of this as possible. There would be some nights over breaks where you would call on 
            the verge of tears, sad and angered by your parents. Of course, the right response in this situation for me is to listen and 
            help you feell better despite your parents trying their best to make you feel bad. And of course, I did this because it was 
            absolutlely what you needed in the moment. However, more times than not, those same conversations would turn into something completely 
            ridiculous that was so much fun for both of us, and made both of us laugh our butts off. I am not trying to call myself a perfect boyfriend, 
            I know that I am far from it. All I am trying to illustrate is our ability to have a deep variety in our conversations with each other.

            As I have said in earlier letters, you are someone who I seem to never run out of things to say to. You are the person who I am most
            eager to tell about my day, my highs and lows, and everything in between. You understand how I operate (or at least are trying your 
            best to do so) and love me despite some of my clear shortcomings that often become clear during conversation. I am so thankful that God 
            brought us closer together, because I now know the person I love spending as much time with as I possibly can. Thanks for all the 
            conversations we have had, and here's to many more to come. :)
