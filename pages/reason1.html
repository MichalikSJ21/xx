    <h1>Reason 1</h1>

    <p>
        We get along so unbelievably well. It's just so easy to talk 
        to you, and being in your presence
        always makes me feel so relaxed. I am not kidding when I say that
        the best part of my day is consistently when I 
        get to spend time with you. You lift me up, cheer me up, and always seem to 
        make my days much better than they were before. Spending time with you is 
        almost theraputic... you seem to know exactly what I need before I even have
        to say anything about it. <br> <br>

        Just to give you an example of what I'm talking about... when I am sad about 
        something, you ask me questions and listen to me until I feel better. When I am 
        happy, you rejoice with me. When I am tired and don't have the energy for very much, 
        you are content to just lie with me, with no conversation if need be. <br> <br>

        You are someone who is efforless to be around, regarless of the situation. There are so many
        different dynamics to our relationship, and I enjoy every single one of them. 
        Holding your hand and talking about our days, spending time with Jonah Lexi and Taylor watching 
        a movie, talking while we both try to do homework halfheartedly in STEM, cuddling in our dorms, 
        making out whenever we get the chance, eating a meal together, struggling through Calculus together. 
        Whenever we are doing something together, it literally doesn't matter what it is, I enjoy it. <br> <br>

        I wish I could slow down time and spend much more time with you than I do. 
        Honestly, 12 hours just sitting and cuddling with you and falling asleep in your 
        arms sounds like the perfect day. It is really a shame that both of us actually 
        have lives and need to go do things most days. Someday we should make that happen, it
        would be a great day. Maybe even the best day ever, you never know. <br> <br>

        I guess this really just shows that a big part of my love language is quality time. That is 
        certainly the case for you as well, and I feel like we both do a great job of spending that time
        with one another. Hey if you are reading this right now and have time to spare, come find me, give me 
        a call, or cuddle with me. I would greatly enjoy any of the above, and very much look forward to when I 
        get to spend more time with you. Mara Donley I love you, and I can not wait to keep spending more 
        and more time with you as our relationship grows. <br> <br>

        With Love, <br>

        -Stevie Michalik (your cute boyfriend who loves you very much)
