    <h1>Reason 2</h1>

    <p>
        You are someone who has a very sharp eye on their future. You know what you want
        to do, and how you are going to get there. And you definitely are not gonna sit
        around and wait for someone else to figure it out for you, instead you go and get 
        stuff done and make it happen for yourself. <br> <br>

        I am seriously impressed by how much you are focused on making your dreams of 
        pre-med a reality. There are so many other people in your position who don't even
        think about getting started on their goals and pursuing them in a real sense. Instead, 
        you take the opportunities given to you and make more opportunities out of them. For 
        example: look around in your EMT class and tell me how many other freshmen are there. 
        The answer is (likely) none. You are one of the only people I know completely focused on 
        accomplishing their goals in life and making sure that they get them done. <br> <br>

        I respect your hustle and dedication to your degree so much. You are killing it and know that 
        even though it will be so difficult to go through residency, med-school, and all the other various 
        things, it will be so worth it in the end. I am personally inspired by your huslte, and you should
        definitely know that your hustle inspires myself to be better as well. <br> <br>

        This one is a bit of a shorter one. I guess I am just getting good at being consise. Mara, I am so 
        thankful for you, and thankful for your attitude towards your future. Your hardworking attitude and 
        committment is personally inspiring. <br> <br>

        With Love, <br>
