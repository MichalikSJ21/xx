        <h1>Reason 4</h1>
        <div>
            How you operate and go about your life slightly confuses me, but I think it is incredible and I 
            love how you do it all. I am not gonna lie Mara: sometimes the way you do things is a bit confusing to me. 
            And of course that should be the case: we are human beings who are created differently to do different things.
            But I am very much in love with the human being you are, and am so glad to be able to know you.

            You are such a logical person, yet we both think through things in a very interesting and different way. You 
            invite stress in and welcome it, and honestly that is such a palpable advantage that you can weild throughout 
            your life. That ability is such a huge part of who you are: you are a person who is able to when the moment is most 
            important, make a decisive action that will benefit all who you know. I think what I am trying to say is this: while 
            other people flail under pressure and let stress bog them down, you are able to use stress and pressure as a tool to push
            you forward and onward to great heights.

            There are many reasons why I would never even dream of being an ER Doctor. You know full well that the first time someone
            had to get a fecal transplant, I would be hiding under the table, not wanting anything to do with what was going on. But 
            with the skills you have to so skillfully deal with stress, I have every confidence that you will make a great doctor because 
            of the ability you possess to handle stress in stride.

            But this also has to do with how you deal with emotions, which once again slightly confuses me but I am totally in love with.
            You claim to be a person who feels no emotions and doesn't feel anything, but you very clearly feel strong feelings for 
            both your close friends and your boyfriend. Emotions probably just display themselves in a different way to you... you feel them
            and know that they are there, but sometimes it is hard to know exactly what they are. We are definitely different in that way, but
            it is so incredible to me that you are like that. I am just happy to know I am one of an elite group who you have ever expressed 
            your deep heart felt emotions to :)
        </div>

        <div>
            Long story short: I am so in love with you as a person, and a lot of that starts in the way your brain goes about operating the rest
            of yourself through the world. I welcome the differences in the two of us, dating a second version of myself would be absolutlely no fun 
            in any way shape or form. I can not wait to keep finding out more about how your brain works and how you think through things, and 
            hopefully I will continue to understand you better.

        <div>With Love, </div>
